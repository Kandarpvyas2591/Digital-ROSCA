## Problem Statement

Traditional ROSCAs (also known as chit funds) are widely used in underbanked communities for savings and loans but suffer from:

Manual record-keeping, leading to disputes.

Limited scalability and lack of integration with formal financial services.

Lack of financial literacy, causing mismanagement of lump-sum payouts.


## Our Solution

A digital platform that automates ROSCA contributions, enables peer-to-peer lending, and introduces a reputation system to ensure responsible borrowing and lending.

✅ Smart ROSCA Management – Create & manage savings groups digitally.

✅ Community Micro-Loans – Request and approve loans within trusted groups.

✅ Automated Notifications – email reminders for payments & payouts.
